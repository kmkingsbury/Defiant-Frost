# Defiant-Frost
Google Maps API example and code for planning trips to hike the 4ks in New Hampshire.



* Runs in an Nginx Docker Container on localhost
* Uses the JSON file to load in the mountains, mountains.json is ALL the 4ks, can mark some as completed, by adding a completed field and date, this will also change the pins to a green-dot color.
* @todo : Add in all vs a personalized list.
